# Development Build Guide for Real Ads

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Hybrid AdManager**: Works in both Expo Go and Development Build
‚úÖ **Ad Placeholders**: Shows placeholders in Expo Go
‚úÖ **Real Ads Ready**: Will show real ads in development build

## The Error You Saw
The `TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing(...): 'RNGoogleMobileAdsModule' could not be found` error is **expected** when using Expo Go because:

- **Expo Go** = Managed workflow (no custom native modules)
- **Google Mobile Ads** = Native module (requires custom build)
- **Solution** = Development build with custom native code

## Current Behavior

### In Expo Go (Current):
- ‚úÖ App runs without crashes
- ‚úÖ Shows ad placeholders
- ‚úÖ Logs when ads would show
- ‚ùå No real ads (native module not available)

### In Development Build:
- ‚úÖ App runs with real ads
- ‚úÖ Shows actual Google ads
- ‚úÖ Generates real revenue
- ‚úÖ Full native module support

## Creating Development Build

### Option 1: Local Build (iOS - You have Xcode)
```bash
# Create iOS development build
npx expo run:ios

# This will:
# 1. Generate native iOS project
# 2. Install native dependencies
# 3. Build and install on simulator/device
# 4. Enable real ads
```

### Option 2: EAS Build (Cloud - Recommended)
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Configure EAS
eas build:configure

# Create development build
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

### Option 3: Continue with Expo Go
You can keep using Expo Go for development and testing. The app works perfectly, just with ad placeholders instead of real ads.

## When to Create Development Build

**Create development build when:**
- ‚úÖ You want to test real ads
- ‚úÖ You're ready to publish the app
- ‚úÖ You want to see actual ad revenue
- ‚úÖ You need to test ad performance

**Stay with Expo Go when:**
- ‚úÖ Still developing core features
- ‚úÖ Testing gameplay mechanics
- ‚úÖ Not ready for ads yet
- ‚úÖ Want faster development cycle

## Revenue Impact

### Current Setup (Expo Go):
- **Revenue**: $0 (placeholders only)
- **Development**: Fast and easy
- **Testing**: Perfect for gameplay

### Development Build:
- **Revenue**: Real money from ads
- **Development**: Slightly slower builds
- **Testing**: Real ad experience

## Next Steps

1. **Continue development** in Expo Go for now
2. **Test your game** thoroughly
3. **Get some users** to validate the concept
4. **Create development build** when ready for real ads
5. **Publish to app stores** with real ads enabled

## Quick Test

Your current app will:
- Show `[Ad Placeholder]` text where ads would appear
- Log `"Would show interstitial ad"` every 3 games
- Work perfectly for testing gameplay

When you create a development build, those placeholders will become real ads automatically!

## Need Help?

If you want to create the development build now:
1. Run `npx expo run:ios` (since you have Xcode)
2. Wait for build to complete (5-10 minutes)
3. Real ads will work automatically

The choice is yours - continue with Expo Go for development, or create a development build for real ads! üöÄ
